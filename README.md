Data were collected during a research project conducted on Kakrarahu islet, Estonia. Data are related to Common gull breeding pairs on which flight initiation distance protocols have been conducted over 3 years (2023, 2024, 2025).

## Description of the Data and file structure

The file contains 28 columns.

nest: Unique nest ID, nestnumber_year

BLUPs_25: The best linear unbiased predictors for flight initiation distance (FID), once accounting for the effects of the FID starting distance, trial number, and Julian date the trial was conducted

latitude: Latitude of the nesting site

longitude: Longitude of the nesting site

first_egg_date: Date at which the first egg was laid in the nest

FID_m: Flight initiation distance value, in meters

Repetition: The trial number of the FID protocol, such that when a FID protocol was carried out for the 5th time on the same nest, this repetition number is 5

Zone: Area of the ilset the nesting site was located on

SD_m: Starting distance at which the FID protocol was initiated, in meters

Date: Date the FID protocol was carried on

Time: Time at which the FID protocol was carried on

Year: Year on which the FID protocol was carried on

height_m: Height of the nesting site, based on the Republic of Estonia Land and Spatial Development Board data and GPS coordinates

Egg1: Mass of the 1st egg laid in the nest, in grams

Egg2: Mass of the 2nd egg laid in the nest, in grams

Egg3: Mass of the 3rd egg laid in the nest, in grams

Egg4: Mass of the 4th egg laid in the nest, in grams

TotEgg: Total number of eggs laid in the nest

EggHatched: Total number of eggs hatched in the nest

ProbaChick: Probability to have at least 1 chick hatched in the nest

HatchSucc: Hatching success of the nest, expressed as the number of eggs hatched/the number of eggs laid

ClutchMass: Total mass of the clutch, expressed as Egg1+Egg2+Egg3+Egg4

Chick1: Mass at birth of the 1st chick hatched in the nest, in grams

Chick2: Mass at birth of the 2nd chick hatched in the nest, in grams

Chick3: Mass at birth of the 3rd chick hatched in the nest, in grams

Chick4: Mass at birth of the 4th chick hatched in the nest, in grams

ChickNMass: Total mass of the brood, expressed as Chick1+Chick2+Chick3+Chick4

Count_Larcan_nests_Hannah: Total number of Common gull nests within a 5-meter radius of the focal nest
